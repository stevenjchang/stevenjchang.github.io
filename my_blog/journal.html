      <h3>Day 1: July 16th, 2016</h3>

      <h5>Goal --> I want to be a Blogger, I want to be a YouTuber. A photographer.... </h5>
      <p> basically a creator </p>  
      <p> And overall, just overcoming the fear of sharing my life, of living a public life. You have been scared for way too long. It's just not something I want to be anymore. This is not the way I want to live. I should be able to live differently than this. I should actually be able to put time and effort into the things that I do, such as organizing my photos, or my notes, or even my goals. My life has been so disorganized for some weird reason. Not really sure why.</p>
