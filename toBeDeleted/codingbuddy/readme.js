Okay, lets do this shit.

CodingBuddy.com, or
codingbuddytutorial.com
//establish a learning plan
//build your schedule and system of learning
//find a buddy
//find a remote coding buddy

Make a Plan,
Find a Buddy,
and then put in the time
/* Trying to become a coder?
Trying to learn by yourself?
*/
This is my first real site. 
This is exactly in my wheelhouse. 
Lets get this to stage 1 by March 31st.

What needs to be done in total, and what needs to be done by March 31st

1) How-To-Guide on becoming a Js Developer  // operative word is "Guide"
	A) Sequence
	B) Resources
	C) Set pace and schedule
	D) Motivation, Road-Blocks, and tips

2) How-To-Guide on Finding a Coding-Buddy, Buddies, or Community  // the operative word is ...

3) Coding Buddy Database
	A) Enter yourself into Database
	B) Search Database
	C) Connect to others through Database
// in order to do this stuff, you will need some basic backend framework knowledge

4) Online Coding Buddy
	A) Site-wide chat???
	B) Collaboration Tools Tutorial, and favorite picks

5) Career Counseling

// THAT is IT

BIG PROJECT 1: Build an EMPTY Site  //the site should have everything layed out, just not working internally
	//so what does it need?
	1. Navbar
	2. Homepage
	3. Sign-up page (for coding buddy)
	4. 'How-To' Section

First Goal: //what is your first goal?
	1. Navbar  // can you do it by tonight 3/22?
	2. Homepage 
		a. decide page color 
		b. decide background image / color
		c. make a tab  //the page should be a tutorial page 
		d. make a form for entering your information
		e. Entry Titles: //no need to actually write the article. just write the entry title and a short 1 line blurb.
		f. 


The articles are essentially the advice I already sort of give to people:

Target Goals vs Time Goals.

Okay, its March 30th, exactly 1 month left. 
Lets re-calibrate. 
Lets examine all the info youve been gathering. 

What is your overall objective this month?
--> to be employable. 
What does that mean?
--> to learn Bootstrap
What does did Jeff say? 
--> you should be able to re-create Bootstrap
So what is your overall objective this month?
--> to make a working, functional page. 
Just one?
--> yeah, just one, with everything
What else have you been thinking about?
--> rushing through that Ruby-on-Rails tutorial
Are you going to do that?
--> yes I should do it
What else ahve you been thinking about?
--> Reading that Getify book
Are you going to do it?
--> maybe I should do that in my off time, or not do it at all

What do you have to do?
--> I have to goto bed, and wake up. That is still important, I should aim to improve it
--> I have to be productive at night
--> I have to find a bigger social circle on the weekends.
What else?
--> I have to work out.
--> I have to find an apartment
--> I have to order a flight
--> I have to make a road-map
What about in terms of the group?
--> No idea, just let it ride and be nice to everyone?
--> Keep going to other meetups as a way to expand the group?
Is the group membership set?
Do you think we need one more?
--> You think we need 1 more.

So what is your objective next week. Why are you still so boggled down?
--> because this week is going fast, and I dont have much time for computation.
--> which is why you need a longer roadmap moving forward.
So, what is your roadmap?
--> Maybe I should completely do bootstrap this month?
Did you just confuse yourself again?
--> yeah sorta, I think I did
But is that okay?
--> yeah, its okay, its fine, its whatever
When do you not get stuck, btw?
--> well I dont get stuck when my endgoal is a tangable product 
So?-----
--> right, okay, fucking make a tangable product goal.

Okay, so your goal is the codingbuddy website. Regardless of bootstrap, or JS, its the site, 
that is the goal.
Get it?
--> got it
Good. 

Lets go.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DAY 5 - Wednesday 3/30
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Decide how you want to display the tabs // it should be a new page
10. Decide how to displate the "Study Guide" page, and the table of contents 
		// it should be a 3 grid system, or a large simplified list system
11. Display the Table of Contents in a grid  //very minimally got it to work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Change the original sign up page into a mailing list page 
13. Have the Sign-Up page Pop up

DAY 1 b - Monday 4/4 - The Bootstrap debacle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues -
/* mother fucking, i dont know what to do at the moment. it's rather confusing, like
wtf am i suppose to do? I get confused, and I need to get back on focus. Getting back 
on focus is not easy, and never has been. But there is a certain part of the struggle
which makes you a better teacher in the long run. If you've never struggled then you 
have no clue what others are going through. 
Anyways, I'm stuck, again. Going through the HackReactor Remote Prep w George made me realize
I might be real annoyed attending HR as well. Plus, it is 18k and not in Taiwan.
But now I'm slowing down just a bit. Or not just slowing down, but not going fast enough,
or simply your perception is just pessemistic. 
Dude just keep your eyes on the prize. Even if you don't clearly know what it is, you
clearly know what direction it's at. Don't let a bad day, or an unproductive day shake 
your mood, or make you feel like you aren't progressing fast like a "mother fucking boss",
because you mother fucking are. you are progressing like a mother fucking boss, you went at
a decent speed, and you will keep going at a decent speed, until you can figure out how to 
go even faster, at which point it will be pretty amazing. but even now your speed is good, 
just don't fool yourself into thinking you are failing. don't get down on yourself. don't 
hate, don't campare. don't let your annoyance at Brian to dictate how you behave this week.
Don't worry about him. Fuck him, and then let it go. Just be his friend, not his critic. 
Try to see the good in him. Just like you ended up liking Michael by the end. In the end
he's just trying to help. He's not trying to be a cocky know-it-all. You have to let him know
the right way. And you have to see the good in him also. This is good training for you, just
like Troy and everything else in life that annoy you and bring out bad parts of you.

You have to calulate when you would have graduated from MS or HR if you attended. Then you 
have to set your goals according to that. Because that is your true self-accountable time-line.

Bootstrap:
I think you are in a situation now where you are in over your head. That's why this project is
starting to suck. Like, you don't know how to do too many things. Before it was just a smaller 
scale of what you don't know. So what is the solution? Scale down the project? Abandon it? Put
it off to the side? 

12 Weeks:
Aug 29th would be the full 12 weeks if you attended HR. 
So you should be at a similar level if you don't attend. 

For now, this month, your goal is to be employable. Maybe it's time to start taking the time to
look at free-lance jobs to better understand your goal for this month. Maybe you should learn word-press
template, because it will allow you to be enployable faster. Or you should learn fundamental CSS better.

I honestly don't know the answer at the moment. It seems like this nervous notion of being an free-lanceable
web developer is freaking you out, which is bad, but I think it's also motivating you and you will come
out of it with a much more clearly and tangible game-plan, which can only be good. 
aka. Be freaked out enough to be motivated, and not enough to give up or feel depressed.

But seriously, all of a sudden I don't know what it takes to be a front-end web developer. Or maybe I'm
realizing that I never did. Maybe that is a more acurate way to portray it. WTF seriously, how do I do it?
It's confusing because a Web-Developer actually doesn't need to know JavaScript, and that is really freaking
you out. You've never considered a world where you don't learn JavaScript. I think what makes the most sense
in terms of direct learning is the way Jeff approaches it. But even if I learn all that JS, so I really know
how to make a free-lance web project. Is word-press really the best way to do it? How do I figure it out?

So where you are going wrong is that you think this "soul searching day" is a complete waste
of time, and that is what is making your anxious. But what if it isn't? What if this is called
'sharpening the saw'. What if what results from this would be known as 'working smarter'?
What about that, huh? Does that make you feel better? What you really should worry about is
the truly difficult parts of your life to master. Why can't you wake up earl? Why can't you be
disciplined enough to goto bed, or to brush your teeth at night. Those are things completely
within your control, and the true things you should control. You should control those things this
month, and improve your already good habit of how you log your hours. You don't have a central
focus or project anymore so, putting in 'efficient' coding time can feel difficult. You may
feel significantly less productive. Do not let that dictate your plan this month. 

If you get stuck, start solidifying the topics or content of the site as well. 

Is there a step that you are missing.. that's making everything so damn confusing for you?

*/

and do you think getting a trial subscription to Udacity would solve any problems
/* So after some research, the answer is obviously no. Well, at least in terms of paying any
sort of money for the nano-degree. Because all the videos are posted for free. But does that 
help you much in terms of finding your answer? How-the-fuck do I become a front end developer?
