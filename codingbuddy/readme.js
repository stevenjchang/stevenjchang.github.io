/* Trying to become a coder?
Trying to learn by yourself?
*/
This is my first real site. 
This is exactly in my wheelhouse. 
Lets get this to stage 1 by March 31st.

What needs to be done in total, and what needs to be done by March 31st

1) How-To-Guide on becoming a Js Developer  // operative word is "Guide"
	A) Sequence
	B) Resources
	C) Set pace and schedule
	D) Motivation, Road-Blocks, and tips

2) How-To-Guide on Finding a Coding-Buddy, Buddies, or Community  // the operative word is ...

3) Coding Buddy Database
	A) Enter yourself into Database
	B) Search Database
	C) Connect to others through Database
// in order to do this stuff, you will need some basic backend framework knowledge

4) Online Coding Buddy
	A) Site-wide chat???
	B) Collaboration Tools Tutorial, and favorite picks

5) Career Counseling

// THAT is IT

BIG PROJECT 1: Build an EMPTY Site  //the site should have everything layed out, just not working internally
	//so what does it need?
	1. Navbar
	2. Homepage
	3. Sign-up page (for coding buddy)
	4. 'How-To' Section

First Goal: //what is your first goal?
	1. Navbar  // can you do it by tonight 3/22?
	2. Homepage 
		a. decide page color 
		b. decide background image / color
		c. make a tab  //the page should be a tutorial page 
		d. make a form for entering your information
		e. Entry Titles: //no need to actually write the article. just write the entry title and a short 1 line blurb.
		f. 


The articles are essentially the advice I already sort of give to people:

Target Goals vs Time Goals.
myth: setting the goal of x-hours a day gets it done

				DAY 1 - Tuesday 3/22
