		Here's a list of foods to try while in the Bay:

		AND things you will not be able to.

		Banh-Mi
		at Thung Houng, San Jose
		Like, the best Vietnamese sandwich. 
		yet nothing special about it. 
		strangely, haven't had even an above average banh-mi anywhre else in the bay. 

		Hot Pot
		Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, many-locations
		Their spicy broth is where the money's at. Other places just doesn't seem to have the broth.

		did I mention Hot Pot is my favorite 

		Seoul Burger
		My roommates take every person that visits cali to get a late night seoul burger. Last time Masao was here we went twice in two nights (not sure if it was because of the food)

		Cheeseboard Pizza
		at Cheeseboard or Sliver, Berkeley

		Cajun Shrimp Boil
		at Kickin' Crab, San Jose
		Simple, but SO satisfying

		Taiwan Beef Noodle Soup
		Mama Leung's Kitchen, Milpitas/San Jose

		Tacos

		Pho

		Ramen
