What should your bootstrap project be?

I think the first thing it should be is a:

stevenjchang --->   item a
					item b
					item c
					item d
					item e

like a, who the fuck do i ultimately want to be, sort of board

then the second thing it should be is, 

keeps track of what kind of projects i'm working on
	(maybe it should be hidden, i dunno)
